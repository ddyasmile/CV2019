    Gray scale Reconstruction
    Morphological gradient

There is a 5x5 default structure element and a default anchor (-1,-1) which means the center of SE.

You can click "Setting/..." to change SE size, anchor and structure element.
SE size and anchor are both Tuple.
The input entry of SE size only contains non-negative numbers.
The input entry of Anchor contains non-negative numbers and negative numbers,
    but it don't receive a single '-', so if you want reset anchor as (-1,-1),
    you need directly paste '-1' to input entry.
And you should also directly delete '-1'.
'structure element' is seemed as 'None' default, so there is nothing in input entrys at the first time you see it.
But if you click 'Save' with nothing is input entrys, the structure element will be set with '0'.
You can reset SE to default SE with 'Clean' and exit directly instead of to click 'Save'.
'Clean SE' can reset SE to default SE directly.

Click "Help" to get this.

Enjoy!!
